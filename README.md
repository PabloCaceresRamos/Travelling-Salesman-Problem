# Travelling-Salesman-Problem

14 Different algorithms and techniques have been implemented to solve TSP.

Each algorithm has been tested in different ways to find the best parameters to obtain the best results in the TSP.

All the results have been compared to find the best algorithm able to optimise the shortest path for each file used.

You can see the final results and comparative results on Travelling-Salesman-Problem/Graphs/
